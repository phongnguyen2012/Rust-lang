Instructions
Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:

Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
Earth: orbital period 1.0 Earth years, 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years
So if you were told someone were 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should be able to say that they're 31.69 Earth-years old.

Some Rust topics you may want to read about while solving this problem:

Traits, both the From trait and implementing your own traits

Default method implementations for traits

Macros, the use of a macro could reduce boilerplate and increase readability for this exercise. For instance, a macro can implement a trait for multiple types at once, though it is fine to implement years_during in the Planet trait itself. A macro could define both the structs and their implementations. Info to get started with macros can be found at:

The Macros chapter in The Rust Programming Language
